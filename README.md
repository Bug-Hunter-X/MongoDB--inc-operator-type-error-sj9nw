# MongoDB $inc operator type error
This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB update operations using the $inc operator. The error occurs when a string value is provided instead of a number, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Description:
The provided code attempts to increment the "count" field in a document using the $inc operator. However, the increment value is passed as a string ("1"), which is not handled correctly by MongoDB, resulting in no change to the field.

## Bug Solution:
The solution involves ensuring that the increment value passed to the $inc operator is a number. This can be achieved by providing a numeric literal or a variable that holds a numeric value. This corrected code will correctly increment the count field in the MongoDB document.

## How to reproduce:
1. Create a MongoDB collection named 'myCollection'.
2. Insert a document with a numeric 'count' field into the 'myCollection'.
3. Run the provided buggy code in a MongoDB shell or application.
4. Verify that the count field is not incremented.
5. Run the corrected code, and verify that the field has been incremented correctly.
